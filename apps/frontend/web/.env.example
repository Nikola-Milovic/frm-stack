# Here you can place variables shared across all environments
#
# Vite loads environment variables in the following order:
# 1. .env (loaded in all cases)
# 2. .env.local (loaded in all cases, ignored by git)
# 3. .env.[mode] (e.g., .env.development, .env.production)
# 4. .env.[mode].local (e.g., .env.development.local, ignored by git)
#
# Variables defined in mode-specific files override those in .env
# Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to your app
